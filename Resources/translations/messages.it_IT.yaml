For maximum legibility, a text label should remain on a single line. Refrain from using text buttons without icons or some sort of underscore as they can be perceived as plain text. Don’t use long labels. If long labels appear due to user-provided content such as a shopping list name and there is no way to prevent it, truncate the text and show the full name in a hover tooltip: <br><br><b>PLACEMENT Do</b>: Keep buttons inline when space allows. Group logically connected buttons together. <br><b>PLACEMENT Don’t</b>: Avoid placing destructive actions right next to affirmative ones.

                    description: '<strong>Primary:</strong> provides the strongest visual emphasis to an action with a solid background, should be used one per context. Defining context depends on the hierarchy of information displayed on the screen, the motivated user flow, and the available tasks. For example, a page may have multiple equally important contexts, each requiring its own primary button to complete a task (for example, a product card on the product listing page). A page header is also a single context that requires one primary action - contained button.<br> <strong>Outlined:</strong> indicates a supplemental action with a border that matches the primary color and no fill — one or more can be used per context. For example, Product button in the page header.<br> <strong>Text:</strong> indicates a supplemental borderless action that only has a background during interaction for affordance. Is used for less-pronounced actions than contained or outlined buttons.<br> <strong>Text-no-paddings:</strong>  of the same nature as the text ones, but are used in cases where paddings can break visual alignment. For example, page elements are vertically left-aligned and the Filter button is located at the leftmost — it has no paddings to preserve the visual vertical alignment.'

The choice of this button also depends on the visual hierarchy of the page and user goals, it doesn’t have to be used in every flow.<br> <strong>Primary:</strong> provides optimal click target area and visibility and therefore is used the most (for example, in product cards on the product listing page).<br> <strong>Small:</strong> is used for less significant actions to prevent them from competing with primary ones (for example, In Shopping List button on the product preview image). Despite the visually smaller sizes of this button, its click area should be no less that 44x44 px, this can be achieved with placing this button inside a bigger transparent container.'

They should be used sparingly not to overwhelm the page. Any final confirmation that is destructive must use this variant (unless a browser dialog is used).<br> <strong>Inverse:</strong> is used for the actions on the inverse (in this case dark) background. For example, there are inverse color buttons on the dark-colored page header.'

So far the only example in the UI is the Scroll-to-top button.<br> <strong>Primary:</strong> used for non-destructive CTA that are primary in their context and have to draw attention. This type is mostly used for input confirmation (you can find it in the context of Shopping List). It has to be used sparingly, it cannot be used for pagination arrows or to open an overflow menu or similar actions.<br> <strong>Destructive:</strong> used for the standalone destructive actions like Remove and Delete. If some delete action is repeated many times in the same context (e.g., in every table row), it should NOT use this style because it would create a lot of unnecessary visual noise and draw too much attention.'
